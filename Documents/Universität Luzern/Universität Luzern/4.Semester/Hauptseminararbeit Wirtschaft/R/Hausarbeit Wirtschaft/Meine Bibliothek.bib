	abstract = {Are we being manipulated online? If so, is being manipulated by online technologies and algorithmic systems notably different from human forms of manipulation? And what is under threat exactly when people are manipulated online?

This volume provides philosophical and conceptual depth to debates in digital ethics about online manipulation. The contributions explore the ramifications of our increasingly consequential interactions with online technologies such as online recommender systems, social media, user friendly design, microtargeting, default settings, gamification, and real time profiling. The authors in this volume address four broad and interconnected themes:
What is the conceptual nature of online manipulation? And how, methodologically, should the concept be defined?
Does online manipulation threaten autonomy, freedom, and meaning in life and if so, how?
What are the epistemic, affective, and political harms and risks associated with online manipulation?
What are legal and regulatory perspectives on online manipulation?

This volume brings these various considerations together to offer philosophically robust answers to critical questions concerning our online interactions with one another and with autonomous systems. The Philosophy of Online Manipulation will be of interest to researchers and advanced students working in moral philosophy, digital ethics, philosophy of technology, and the ethics of manipulation.},

In this chapter, I relay some of this conceptual work on virtue signalling, piling on, ramping up, echo-chambers, epistemic bubbles, polarization, moral outrage porn, and the gamification of communication. In drawing attention to these things, philosophers hope to steer us towards being better online. One form that this takes is a call for more civility (both online and off). There is a good case to be made for this; social media is a mess, and we should be kinder and look to communicate better with each other. But there is also a good objection: Civility, and calls for civility and politeness, can placate serious resistance to power and wrongdoing. What we ought to be doing is resisting power, looking to protect democracy and mitigating the climate crisis. And given that, so the objection goes, focusing on civility is at best wrong-headed, and at worst counterproductive to real needed change. How then are we to negotiate the call for civility with the need for real change? The hope is that we can be better online and work towards serious change together.},

	abstract = {“Gamification” refers to adding game-like elements to non-game activities so as to encourage participation. Gamification is used in various contexts: apps on phones motivating people to exercise, employers trying to encourage their employees to work harder, social media companies trying to stimulate user engagement, and so on and so forth. Here, I focus on gamification with this property: the game-designer (a company or other organization) creates a “game” in order to encourage the players (the users) to bring about certain outcomes as a side effect of playing the game. The side effect might be good for the user (e.g., improving her health) and/or good for the company or organization behind the game (e.g., advertising their products, increasing their profits, etc.). The “players” of the game may or may not be aware of creating these side effects; and they may or may not approve of/endorse the creation of those side effects. The organizations behind the games, in contrast, are typically directly aiming to create games that have the side effects in question. These aspects of gamification are puzzling and interesting from the point of view of philosophical analyses of agency and responsibility for outcomes. In this paper, I relate these just-mentioned aspects of gamification to some philosophical discussions of responsibility gaps, the ethics of side effects (including the Knobe effect and the doctrine of double effect), and ideas about the relations among different parties’ agency.},

How should we model the spread of hate? This article considers two models. First, I consider a simple contagion model. In this model, hate spreads like a virus through a social network. This model, however, fails to capture the fact that people do not acquire hatred from a single infectious contact. Instead, it builds up in a person's beliefs and attitudes through time until the infection reaches a level where the subject themselves becomes a generator of hate speech. Second, to accommodate this, I consider an alternative model known as complex contagion. I argue that not only is a complex contagion model more explanatory and predictive, but it can be used to explain why certain features of social media cause it to be a promoter of hate. I conclude by sketching some mitigation strategies.},

In response to Q1, I contend that both online echo chambers and online epistemic bubbles threaten to undermine the cultivation and preservation of open-mindedness, albeit via different mechanisms and to different degrees. In response to Q2, I affirm that both a deficiency and excess of open-mindedness can be virtuous in these online environments, depending on the epistemic orientation of the digital user.},

	abstract = {We combine philosophical theories with quantitative analyses of online data to propose a sophisticated approach to social media influencers. Identifying influencers as communication systems emerging from a dialectic interactional process between content creators and in-development audiences, we define them mainly using the composition of their audience and the type of publications they use to communicate. To examine these two parameters, we analyse the audiences of 619 Instagram accounts of French, English, and American influencers and 2,400 of their publications in light of Girard’s mimetic theory and McLuhan’s media theory. We observe meaningful differences in influencers’ profiles, typical audiences, and content type across influencers’ classes, supporting the claim that such communication systems are articulated around ‘reading contracts’ upon which influencers’ image is based and from which their influence derives. While the upkeep of their influence relies on them sticking to this contract, we observe that successful influencers shift their content type when growing their audiences and explain the strategies they implement to address this double bind. Different types of contract breaches then lead to distinct outcomes, which we identify by analysing various types of followers’ feedback. In mediating social interactions, digital platforms reshape society in various ways; this interdisciplinary study helps understand how the digitalisation of social influencers affects reciprocity and mimetic behaviours.},

As time passes the Millennial generation’s contemporary influence is becoming increasingly prominent as those born between 1981 and 1996 represent a sustainable audience for marketers. Millennials are native to digital, with social media a notorious element within their interconnected lives. Social platforms are purposely designed to capture users into consuming the platform for long periods of time, and to return regularly to do so – as stated by former Facebook President Sean Parker. Thus, understanding what appeals social platforms use to execute this tactic on Millennial users holds importance – as to provide greater insight into the social media marketing realm, relative to a prominent generation.

Past research surrounding this tends to incur a generalised approach, regarding either social media or social media users. This study differs in this regard – focusing solely on the platform of Instagram, detailing the relationship between digital experience, which has been underlined as the elements of ‘Social Value’, ‘Content Value’ and ‘Infinite Scroll’, in conjunction with how Instagram capture the Millennial generation unconsciously for long periods of time – otherwise known as a ‘Flow’ state.

The study is based upon current literature which has suggested capturing users in a Flow state as a tactic utilized by social media platforms, and further indicated Social Value, Content Value and Infinite Scroll as drivers of this.

Gamification has been shown to lead to greater motivation and participation among students. Currently, many teachers use social networks to share supplementary course materials and student work, but they have not incorporated gamified educational activities into social networking sites.
Objective
To determine nursing students' satisfaction with an Instagram-based educational game and their perceptions of its effects on their learning.
Design
We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study.
Participants
First-year nursing students in the subject “Dietetics and Nutrition”.
Results
Of the total sample, 71.7 \% agreed that gamification had helped them assimilate the content. Between 66 \% and 70 \% agreed that the experience had motivated them to keep up with the subject and learn more about the topic, that it had helped them to better understand certain concepts of the subject, that they would recommend the experience to other students, and that they enjoyed the experience of playing a game while learning. 71.7 \% of them were in favour of increased use of gamification in other subjects.
Conclusions
The use of an Instagram-based educational game as a complement to in-class teaching was useful, enjoyable, and motivating for the acquisition of new knowledge.},

Beginning with an introduction to epistemic injustice, the article contextualizes its significance in Southeast Asia, highlighting the region’s digital challenges and opportunities. It then proposes characteristics necessary for ideal social media platforms, drawing on Habermas’s public sphere and Rawls’s justice principles to advocate for spaces that promote inclusive and rational discourse. The core analysis centers on X, suggesting that its features could make it a superior choice for fostering a just digital environment globally. The article recommends specific improvements for X to evolve into an ideal social platform, addressing challenges such as cyberbullying, echo chambers, and misinformation. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of prioritizing epistemic justice in social media platforms to achieve a more inclusive and fairer digital public sphere, with Southeast Asia serving as a representative example of a less-than-ideal environment where such platforms could thrive.},

I begin by proposing a situated concept of epistemic agency as fundamental for evaluating epistemic environments. Next, I show that algorithmic personalisation of information makes social networking platforms problematic for users’ epistemic agency because these platforms do not allow users to adapt their behaviour sufficiently. Using the tracing principle inspired by the ethics of self-driving cars, I operationalise it here and identify three requirements that automated epistemic environments need to fulfil: (a) the users need to be afforded a range of skilled actions; (b) users need to be sensitive to the possibility to use their skills; (c) the habits built when adapting to the platform should not undermine the user’s pre-existing skills. I then argue that these requirements are almost impossible to fulfil all at the same time on current SN platforms; yet nevertheless, we need to pay attention to these whenever we evaluate an epistemic environment with automatic features. Finally, as an illustration, I show how Twitter, a popular social networking platform, will fare regarding these requirements.},

It offers step-by-step instructions for implementing the three principal types of qualitative text analysis: thematic, evaluative, and type-building. Special attention is paid to how to present your results and use qualitative data analysis software packages, which are highly recommended for use in combination with qualitative text analysis since they allow for fast, reliable, and more accurate analysis. The book shows in detail how to use software, from transcribing the verbal data to presenting and visualizing the results.

	abstract = {A new challenger seeks to enter the German party system: Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW). With her new party, former Die Linke politician Sahra Wagenknecht combines a left-authoritarian profile (economically left-leaning, but culturally conservative) with anti-US, pro-Russia and anti-elitist stances. This article provides the first large-n academic study of the voter potential of this new party by using a quasi-representative sample (n = 6,000) drawn from a Voting Advice Application-like dataset that comes from a website designed to explore the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht’s positions. The results show that congruence with foreign policy positions and anti-elitism are strong predictors of the propensity to vote for the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht. In contrast, social/welfare and immigration policies are less predictive for assessing the party’s potential. Among the different socio-demographic groups, the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht has a strong potential among baby boomers, the less educated and East Germans. Regarding party voters, the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht is favoured by supporters of some minor parties like dieBasis, Freie Wähler and Die PARTEI, but also non-voters. Among the established parties, the party’s potential is high among Die Linke voters and, to a lesser extent, voters of the Social democrats (SPD) and Alternative for Germany (AfD). A potential below the average is reported for the supporters of the Liberals (FDP) and Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and most clearly for Green and Volt voters.},

	abstract = {This book discusses the Party for Freedom (PVV), a political party in the Netherlands, founded and led by Geert Wilders. Attaining between 10 and 18\% of the votes, the PVV has become one of the largest parties in the Netherlands and is the only political party worldwide without members. Between 2010 and 2012 the party supported a minority coalition of liberals and christian-democrats in exchange for influence on governmental policy. The PVV can be viewed as the Dutch version of an ideological family of nationalist parties linked by their opposition to immigration and to the political and cultural elites. Within this family, Geert Wilders has played an important role as pioneer of a new master frame, in which Islam is portrayed as the historical arch-enemy of the West. As the main figurehead of European islamophobia, Wilders has inspired political parties and organizations in Europe, North-America, Israel and even Australia.
Examining data collected on various aspects of the party (for example, voters, activists, organization and ideology) and employing theoretical insights from sociology, electoral geography and political science, this book analyses this controversial phenomenon and seeks to obtain a clearer picture of the functioning of the PVV. This book will be of interest to students and scholars interested in European politics and current affairs more generally.},

	abstract = {"Explaining the Donald Trump phenomenon is a challenge that will occupy critical theorists of U.S. politics for years to come. Firstly, Donald Trump won the Republican primary contest and is now a contender in the U.S. Presidential Election because he is the master of media spectacle, which he has deployed to create resonant images of himself in his business career, in his effort to become a celebrity and reality-TV superstar, and now his political campaign. More disturbingly, Trump embodies Authoritarian Populism and has used racism, nationalism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and the disturbing underside of American politics to mobilize his supporters in his successful Republican primary campaign and in the hotly contested 2016 general election.The Trump phenomenon is a teachable moment that helps us understand the changes and contour of U.S. politics in the contemporary moment and the role of broadcast media, new media and social networking, and the politics of the spectacle. Trump reveals the threat of authoritarian populism, a phenomenon that is now global in scope, and the dangers of the rise to power of an individual who is highly destructive, who represents the worst of the 1 percent billionaire business class who masquerades as a “voice of the forgotten man” as he advances a political agenda that largely benefits the rich and the military, and who is a clear and present danger to U.S. democracy and global peace. The book documents how Trump’s rise to global celebrity and now political power is bound up with his use of media spectacle and how his use of authoritarian populism has created a mass movement beyond his presidency and a danger to the traditions of U.S. democracy as well as economic security and world peace."},

	abstract = {This study seeks to understand the political discourse of Javier Milei and to determine which concept of populism best captures his approach. Although perceived by many as a populist, Milei is unusual in that he sees himself as a liberal libertarian and defender of the West against collectivist policies. To this end, this study analyzes selected speeches by Milei from three different periods during and after the 2024 presidential election campaign and applies a deductive coding scheme designed to identify ideational populism, populist discursive framing, populism as strategy, and populism as crisis performance. The analysis confirms that Milei is at best a partial populist, as he fails to define the core populist concept of “the people”. It concludes that the concept of crisis performance emerges as the most apt theoretical framework to classify Milei’s type of populism. By rhetorically transforming the crisis not only into an existential economic issue but also into a moral tale of corruption and failure at the highest levels, he can appeal for radical change and offer himself as the national political savior. Milei’s discourse also illustrates that, unlike ideological populism or discursive populist framing, in the performative turn, the victims of the crisis, the people, often remain a vague signifier defined by their suffering at the hands of elites.},

	shorttitle = {The {Presidentialization} of {Politics}},
	abstract = {The Presidentialization of Politics shows that the politics of democratic societies is moving towards a presidentialized working mode, even in the absence of formal institutional changes. These developments can be explained by a combination of long-term structural changes in modern politics and societies' contingent factors which fluctuate over time. While these contingent, short-term factors relate to the personalities of office holders, the overall political agenda, and the majority situation in parliament, there are several structural factors which are relatively uniform across modern nations. First, the internationalization of modern politics (which is particularly pronounced within the European Union) has led to an 'executive bias' of the political process which has strengthened the role of political top elites vis-à-vis their parliamentary groups and/or their parties. Their predominance has been amplified further by the vastly expanded steering capacities of state machineries which have severely reduced the scope of effective parliamentary control. At the same time, the declining stability of political alignments has increased the proportion of citizens whose voting decisions are not constrained by long-standing party loyalties. In conjunction with the mediatization of politics, this has increased the capacity of political leaders to by-pass their party machines and to appeal directly to voters.  As a result, three interrelated processes have led to a political process increasingly moulded by the inherent logic of presidentialism: increasing leadership power and autonomy within the political executive; increasing leadership power and autonomy within political parties; and increasingly leadership-centred electoral processes.  The book presents evidence for this process of presidentialization for 14 modern democracies (including the US and Canada). While there are substantial cross-national differences, the overall thesis holds: modern democracies are increasingly following a presidential logic of governance through which leadership is becoming more central and more powerful, but also increasingly dependent on successful immediate appeal to the mass public. Implications for democratic theory are considered.},

Like disruptive entrepreneurs, these parties offer new policies and defy the dominance of established party brands. In the face of these challenges and a more volatile electorate, mainstream parties are losing their grip on power. In this book, Catherine De Vries and Sara Hobolt explore why some challenger parties are so successful and what mainstream parties can do to confront these political entrepreneurs. Drawing analogies with how firms compete, De Vries and Hobolt demonstrate that political change is as much about the ability of challenger parties to innovate as it is about the inability of dominant parties to respond. Challenger parties employ two types of innovation to break established party dominance: they mobilize new issues, such as immigration, the environment, and Euroscepticism, and they employ antiestablishment rhetoric to undermine mainstream party appeal. Unencumbered by government experience, challenger parties adapt more quickly to shifting voter tastes and harness voter disenchantment. Delving into strategies of dominance versus innovation, the authors explain why European party systems have remained stable for decades, but also why they are now increasingly under strain. As challenger parties continue to seek to disrupt the existing order, Political Entrepreneurs shows that their ascendency fundamentally alters government stability and democratic politics.},

In Germany, the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) adapted its policy positions and performative style and took advantage of the changing circumstances in the pandemic. The pandemic situation thus provided a political opportunity for the AfD to grow its own political repertoire, acting as a challenger party. An overview of evolving party strategy and a content analysis of select legislative debates held in the Bundestag between the outbreak of the pandemic in February 2020 and August 2021 shows that the AfD behaved as an “issue entrepreneur” in the months after the onset of the public health crisis and that it used its populist critique of the government-managed response to the public health crisis to inform a parliamentary strategy of disruption. The party’s behavior led to more adversarial and polarized parliamentary politics. This is relevant to the broader study of pressures imparted by the pandemic crisis on parliamentary governance as well as of today’s populist far-right parties and their impact on parliamentary democracy.},

	abstract = {This paper examines populist claims-making in US presidential elections. We define populism as a discursive strategy that juxtaposes the virtuous populace with a corrupt elite and views the former as the sole legitimate source of political power. In contrast to past research, we argue that populism is best operationalized as an attribute of political claims rather than a stable ideological property of political actors. This analytical strategy allows us to systematically measure how the use of populism is affected by a variety of contextual factors. Our empirical case consists of 2,406 speeches given by American presidential candidates between 1952 and 1996, which we code using automated text analysis. Populism is shown to be a common feature of presidential politics among both Democrats and Republicans, but its prevalence varies with candidates' relative positions in the political field. In particular, we demonstrate that the probability of a candidate's reliance on populist claims is directly proportional to his distance from the center of power (in this case, the presidency). This suggests that populism is primarily a strategic tool of political challengers, and particularly those who have legitimate claims to outsider status. By examining temporal changes in populist claims-making on the political left and right, its variation across geographic regions and field positions, and the changing content of populist frames, our paper contributes to the debate on populism in modern democracies, while integrating field theory with the study of institutional politics.},

They are prime examples of the personalization of politics and the decline of political parties. This volume systematically examines these two prominent developments in contemporary democratic politics and the relationship between them. It presents a cross-national comparative comparison that covers around 50 years in 26 democracies through the use of more than 20 indicators. It offers the most comprehensive comparative cross-national estimation of the variance in the levels and patterns of party change and political personalization among countries to date, using existing works as well injecting fresh cross-national comparative data. In the case of party change, it offers an analysis that extends beyond the dichotomous debate of party decline versus party adaptation. In the matter of political personalization, the emphasis on variance helps in bridging between the high theoretical expectations and disappointing empirical findings. As for the theoretically sound linkage between the two phenomena, not only is this the first study to comprise a comprehensive cross-national examination, but it also proposes a more nuanced understanding of this relationship.

	abstract = {Why do some politicians employ populist rhetoric more than others within the same elections, and why do the same politicians employ more of it in some elections? Building on a simple formal theoretical model of two-candidate elections informed by the ideational approach to populist communication, we argue that the initially less popular political actors are more likely to use populist rhetoric in a gamble to have at least some chance of winning. To test the empirical implications of our argument, we construct the most comprehensive corpus of U.S. presidential campaign speeches (1952–2016) and estimate the prevalence of populist rhetoric across these speeches with a novel automated text analysis method utilizing active learning and word embedding. Overall, we show the robustly greater use of populism among the presidential candidates with the lower polling numbers regardless of their partisanship or incumbency status.},

	abstract = {The Olympic Games and the Football World Cups are among the most expensive projects in the world. While available theoretical explanations suggest that the revenues of mega-events are overestimated and the costs underestimated, there is no comprehensive empirical study on whether costs exceed revenues. Based on a custom-built database from public sources, this article compares the revenues and costs of the Olympic Games and World Cups between 1964 and 2018 (N = 43), together totalling close to USD 70 billion in revenues and more than USD 120 billion in costs. It finds that costs exceeded revenues in most cases: more than four out of five Olympics and World Cups ran a deficit. The average return-on-investment for an event was negative (– 38\%), with mean costs of USD 2.8 billion exceeding mean revenues of USD 1.7 billion per event. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal, the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and the 2002 World Cup in Japan/South Korea recorded the highest absolute deficits. The Summer Olympics 1984 in Los Angeles, the Winter Olympics 2010 in Vancouver and the 2018 World Cup in Russia are among the few events that posted a surplus. The article concludes that the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup suffer from a structural deficit and could not exist without external subsidies. This finding urges a re-evaluation of these events as loss-making ventures that lack financial sustainability.},

	abstract = {Football is an integral part of Brazil’s historical-cultural process, and tourism represents one of the segments deeply impacted by the occurrence of sporting mega-events. The present study aims to present and critically reflect on the main legacies and impacts that these events brought to the Brazilian population. This paper is based on notes surrounding the legacies put forward for the city of São Paulo. To do this, information gathering lends to suggestions that help situate future planning and organization. The purpose of this paper concerns sociocultural and economic futures and the role of tourism and events for local communities based on the current realities and challenges in Brazil. The article is based on a qualitative approach, where descriptive and explanatory information is triangulated. This study utilizes a range of methods, employing a combination of bibliographic research, documentary analysis, and content analysis to frame the base of the research. Moreover, we use field research techniques such as semi-structured interviews with managers, questionnaires administered to residents, interviews with local representatives, direct observation, and active participation in events held at the main stadium associated with sport mega-events in São Paulo, namely, the Neo Química Arena. Noteworthy findings demonstrate a discrepancy between the objectives pursued by host city planners, who strive to maximize the positive legacies encompassing local infrastructure, stadiums, and the city’s image, and the experiences reported by local residents, who have encountered negative impacts and legacies resulting from the same sport mega-event. These adverse effects include issues such as flooding, gentrification, exclusion from decision-making processes, and real estate speculation. Stadiums are considered the greatest tangible legacies of sport mega-events, although their construction and maintenance costs are questionable. The participation of local residents seems to be essential in the promotion, knowledge, appropriation, belonging, support, and transparency in all phases of the mega-event planning.},

Wenn das Spiel – ähnlich wie Kunst oder Literatur – eine fiktive Welt schafft, die sich kontrafaktisch zu unserer Wirklichkeit verhält, welche Gemeinsamkeiten haben diese Welten dann noch? Ist im Spiel nicht alles möglich und erlaubt, was durch die Spielregeln gestattet ist? Die Freiheit des Spiels – eine seiner Grundvoraussetzungen – erlaubt alle denkbaren Regeln und schreckt auch vor Spielmechanismen nicht zurück, die wir in unserer Wirklichkeit für unethisch oder unmoralisch halten. Bedrohung, Verrat, Heimtücke, Gift und Mord sind nicht selten gängige Methoden in Rollenspielen. Das Opfern ganzer Armeen – oder wenigstens einiger Bauern – ist wiederum für Strategiespieler gängige Praxis und kaum einer fragt sich, ob der einzelne Fußsoldat unter der Schlacht gelitten hat. Haben solche Fragen überhaupt etwas mit Ethik und Moral zu tun? Gibt es eine Moral im Spiel oder ist gar eine Ethik des Spielens gefordert? Das Buch gibt die Antworten aus der Perspektive von Michael Conrad, Mario Donick, Erik Eschmann, Stephan Härle, Christian Klager, Lisa Schulmeister und Thomas West, die sich diesem Thema auf einer gemeinsamen Tagung an der Universität Rostock gestellt haben.},

	abstract = {Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) argued that the supreme principle ofmorality is a standard of rationality that he dubbed the“Categorical Imperative” (CI). Kant characterized the CIas an objective, rationally necessary and unconditional principle thatwe must always follow despite any natural desires or inclinations wemay have to the contrary. All specific moral requirements, accordingto Kant, are justified by this principle, which means that all immoralactions are irrational because they violate the CI. Otherphilosophers, such as Hobbes, Locke and Aquinas, had also argued thatmoral requirements are based on standards of rationality. However,these standards were either instrumental principles of rationality forsatisfying one’s desires, as in Hobbes, or external rationalprinciples that are discoverable by reason, as in Locke and Aquinas.Kant agreed with many of his predecessors that an analysis ofpractical reason reveals the requirement that rational agents mustconform to instrumental principles. Yet he also argued that conformityto the CI (a non-instrumental principle), and hence to moralrequirements themselves, can nevertheless be shown to be essential torational agency. This argument was based on his striking doctrine thata rational will must be regarded as autonomous, or free, in the senseof being the author of the law that binds it. The fundamentalprinciple of morality — the CI — is none other than thelaw of an autonomous will. Thus, at the heart of Kant’s moralphilosophy is a conception of reason whose reach in practical affairsgoes well beyond that of a Humean ‘slave’ to the passions.Moreover, it is the presence of this self-governing reason in eachperson that Kant thought offered decisive grounds for viewing each aspossessed of equal worth and deserving of equal respect.},

The article argues that ethical decision-making programs based on ethical training programs developed in business offer a large potential for prevention programs in sport.

	abstract = {How do international sports events shape repression in authoritarian host countries? International tournaments promise unique gains in political prestige through global media attention. However, autocrats must fear that foreign journalists will unmask their wrongdoings. We argue that autocracies solve this dilemma by strategically adjusting repression according to the spatial-temporal presence of international media. Using original, highly disaggregated data on the 1978 World Cup, we demonstrate that the Argentine host government largely refrained from repression during the tournament but preemptively cleared the streets beforehand. These adjustments specifically occurred around hotels reserved for foreign journalists. Additional tests demonstrate that (1) before the tournament, repression turned increasingly covert, (2) during the tournament, targeting patterns mirrored the working shifts of foreign journalists, (3) after the tournament, regime violence again spiked in locations where international media had been present. Together, the article highlights the human costs of megaevents, contradicting the common whitewashing rhetoric of functionaries.},

	abstract = {This is the first book to define and explore the geopolitical economy of sport – the intersection of power, politics, money, and state interests that both exploit and shape elite sport around the world. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the global response, and the consequent ramifications for sport have put the geopolitical economy of sport front and centre in both public debate and academic thinking. Similarly, the Winter Olympics in Beijing and the FIFA World Cup in Qatar illustrate the political, economic, and geographic imperatives that shape modern sport. This book brings together studies from around the world to describe this new geopolitical economy of sport, from the way in which countries use natural resource revenues, accusations of sport washing, and the deployment of sport for soft power purposes, to the way in which sport has become a focus for industrial development. This book looks at the geopolitical economy of sport across the globe, from the Gulf States’ interests in European soccer to Israel seeking to build a national competitive advantage by positioning itself as a global sports tech start-up hub, and the United States continuing to extend its economic and cultural influence through geopolitical sport activities in Africa, Latin America, and the Indian subcontinent. This book captures a pivotal moment in the history of sport and sport business. This is essential reading for any student, researcher, practitioner, or policymaker with an interest in sport business, the politics of sport, geopolitics, soft power, diplomacy, international relations, or international political economy.},

In doing so, these GCC monarchies instrumentalise football for the projection of soft power with the aim of preserving geostrategic interests, consolidating legitimacy and promoting a respective national ‘football identity’. As such, they are competing for ‘beauty’, ‘brilliance’ and ‘benignity’. In addition, sports (particularly football) are drivers of domestic and international human development, as GCC states such as Qatar are increasingly investing in Sports for Development (S4D) efforts. As sport diplomacy is also at risk of ‘soft disempowerment’, S4D provides an instrument to counter international criticism and promote social cohesion and national identity politics.},

These efforts include investments in a diverse portfolio of sports properties, including hosting marquee professional sporting events at home and financing leagues and teams abroad. It is all part of Saudi Arabia’s ‘Vision 2030’ strategic plan to diversify the Kingdom’s economy. This paper discusses the foreign and domestic policy purposes underlying Saudi Arabia’s sports diplomacy and their wider implications for the global economy. I argue that the sports diplomacy initiated by MBS is an investment both in the long-term strategic interests of Saudi Arabia and in the longevity of the ruling regime. Soft power accumulation, as would be predicted by the sports mega-events literature, is a secondary consideration. This paper unfolds in three parts, First, I discuss the relationship between sportswashing, sports diplomacy, and soft power. Second, I provide an overview of Saudi Arabia’s sports engagements since 2014. Third, I explain Saudi Arabia’s behaviour relative to the literature on sports diplomacy. Fourth, I explain Saudi Arabia’s sports diplomacy with reference to the goals laid out in its Vision 2030 policy. I conclude with a discussion of the wider implications of Saudi Arabia’s sports diplomacy.},

This paper offers four advances in conceptualizing sportswashing: (a) the practice is not just the domain of autocrats, but can emerge in democracies as well; (b) domestic audiences are crucial to understanding the political complexities of sportswashing; (c) sportswashing often sets the stage for military intervention; and (d) new forms of sportswashing are emerging, with authoritarian regimes funding teams and events in democratic states.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to discuss clashing narratives around the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup through the lenses of nation branding, public diplomacy, and country image. Beyond the athletic competition, Qatar 2022 was also a cultural clash between East and West, or the Global North and the Global South as it was the first time such a significant mega-event was held in the Arab and Muslim world. While western countries and media framed the event as a sportswashing attempt by Qatar to distract from the death toll of migrant workers, corruption, discriminative policies against the LGBTQ community, and environmental damage, the Qataris positioned the competition as part of a long-term nation building strategy, while counter-criticizing using whataboutism and even through accusations of orientalism and Islamophobia. This case study discusses five areas of dualities in which nation branding and related fields manifested through Qatar 2022: (a) Clashes of civilizations and colonial imperialism, (b) Sportswashing, soft Power, and nation building, (c) Nationalism in a globalized world, (d) Everyone can engage in cultural diplomacy, and (e) Sustainability, inclusion, and greenwashing. The study is significant as it contributes to existing literature nuanced, critical, and at times self-contradicting discussion on sports, nation branding, and related fields, in the context of globalization and the complexity of Middle East geopolitics.},

	abstract = {States intervene increasingly in financing and organization of Olympic elite sport in order to maximize national success in the medal table. In Germany and many other countries too that includes practices that have been criticized as unacceptable in democratic societies: funding of medal-promising sports only, early selection and specialization of young athletes, authoritarian tendencies in sport policy, etc. Are those efforts reflected by a strong desire for medals within the population? Is national success regarded as so important that even critical measures are accepted? And would that indicate more general tendencies to nationalistic or authoritarian attitudes? These and other questions were addressed in a survey carried out in Germany in 2012 (N = 899). Results show that medals are indeed perceived as important, especially in lower educational levels, but by far not as important as sticking to sporting values and the rules of fair play. Multivariate analyses reveal that the desire for medal success is highly dependent on the belief in and perception of the Olympic competition. For most of the respondents that does not legitimize unfair practices or exploiting athletes, but partly the struggle for medals is also linked with a limited understanding of fair play and nationalistic or authoritarian attitudes.},

	abstract = {A central argument for public funding of elite sport is the claim that success at the Olympic Games or world championships leads to increasing international prestige for cities and states. While this assumption seems plausible in general, it clearly lacks specification. Given this, we first discuss here several theoretical approaches in order to unpack which forms of prestige can be sought by states in which kind of sports and events. Second, we summarize the (rather limited) state of empirical research on the topic. Third, secondary data, offering possible indicators for sport-induced changes in international prestige, are presented and discussed. The resulting picture reveals that the formula ‘the more success, the more prestige’ is too simple. The paper concludes by suggesting methodological approaches towards a more systematic analysis of states’ use of sport to acquire international prestige.},

The ‘myth of autonomy’ which suggested that sport should and did have little effect on other human activities has been largely undermined; indeed, we might argue that in some cases there has been an overreaction against it. Modern sport is increasingly and perhaps essentially international and has had an international dimension almost from the outset. It has developed highly autonomous international organizations, most notably the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, the international (association) football federation.},

	abstract = {European Foreign and Security Policy The EU represents one in a series of efforts to integrate Europe since World War II, and to achieve, inter alia, diplomatic stability and military security. In 1957 the Treaty of Rome established the European Economic Community (EEC), that was renamed European Communities (EC) by the Maastricht Treaty in 1993. A series of further international treaties and treaty revisions based largely on this model led eventually to the creation of the EU. In the early 1970s the European Political Cooperation (EPC; renamed the Common Foreign and Security Policy by the Maastricht Treaty), consisting of regular meetings of the foreign ministers of each country, was established to coordinate foreign policy. As part of the second pillar of the Maastricht Treaty, members undertook to define and implement common foreign and security policies. Members agreed that, where possible, they would adopt common defense policies, which would be implemented through the Western European Union (WEU), a security organization that included many EU members. The WEU, that run from 1955 until 2011, was made up of 10countries, and operated as a forum for the coordination of matters of European security and defense. The WEU became the primary defense institution of the EU in the 1990s, though it gave up that role in 2001. The assembly of the WEU consisted of the delegates of the member countries to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). The Council of Europe (CoE) is an older and wider circle of nations than the 28-member European Union —it includes, for example, Russia and Turkey among its member states. The WEU contributed to the creation of the NATO and worked in cooperation with the Atlantic Alliance. NATO and the EU currently have 22 member countries in common. Relations between NATO and the EU were institutionalized in 2001, building on steps taken during the 1990s to promote greater European responsibility in defense matters. The 2002 NATO-EU Declaration on a European Security and DefencePolicy (ESDP) set out the political principles underlying the relationship and reaffirmed EU assured access to NATO’s planning capabilities for the EU’s own military operations. Finally, in 2007 the Lisbon Treaty consolidatedforeign policy representation for the EU. Since the LisbonTreaty entered into force in 2009, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is the chiefcoordinatorand representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), and ex officio a Vice-President of the European Commission. Presenting the European Security Strategy adopted in December 2003, then Secretary-General of the Council of the EU/High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, stated: “Europe has never been so prosperous, so secure nor so free. The violence of the first half of the 20th Century has given way to a period of peace and stability unprecedented in European history”. No statement was more wrong. All EU member states are at the same time participating States of the Organizationfor Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the world's largest security-oriented intergovernmental organization, established in 1973 as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), and renamed OSCE in 1995. Since the beginning, the EC, and, since 1993, the EU have played a vital role in the work of the OSCE. Over the years, the scope of co-operation between the OSCE and the EU has both broadened and deepened, following development of the CFSP, and the launch of the first EU crisis management operations under the European Security and DefencePolicy (CSDP), the EU course of action in the fields of defense and crisis management, and a main component of the CFSP. Through the European NeighbourhoodPolicy (ENP), that applies to Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia and Ukraine, the EU aims to strengthen the prosperity, stability and security of all. The ENP includes ten Mediterranean countries, six post-Soviet states, and Western Balkan countries. European Border Conflicts Timeline Regional conflicts that occurred at the doors of the EU since the end of WorldWar II:  Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948-present) Cyprus conflict(1974-present) Post-Soviet conflicts— Georgia, Armenia, and Russia (1990-present) Post-Soviet ‘FrozenConflicts’— Transnistria (Moldova), Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh), Abkhazia (Georgia), South Ossethia( Georgia) (1991-present) Yugoslav Wars— Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Kosovo(1991-2001) Chechen Wars (1994-1996; 1999-2000) Kosovo War (1998-1999) NATO bombing of Yugoslavia(1999) Turkey’s authoritarian turn (2002-present) War in Ingushetia (2007-2015) Independence of Kosovo (2008) Russian-GeorgianWar (2008) Insurgency in the North Caucasus (2009-2017) Arab Springs (2010-2012) Libyan Civil War (2011-present) Syria Civil War (2011-present) Egyptian coup d'état (2013) Donbass Conflict in East Ukraine (2014-present) Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation (2014) The EU: a Global or a Vain and Weak-Willed Actor? Alongside non-international and international conflicts, a third category of armed conflict is emerging: hybrid, asymmetric, and transnational conflicts which involve state and non-state actors such as insurgents and terrorists. Unconventional conflicts are among the trend topics of defense and security, and they pose a threat to the stability of international order. Hybrid conflicts, involving state and non-state actors, characterize the post ColdWar era. These conflicts challenge the ability of international organizations to address them, and so far the EU was unable to settle them.  Afterthe breakup of Yugoslavia(1990-1992) NATO started a military campaign in Kosovo and bombed Yugoslavia(1999). The independence of Kosovo is not recognized by all EU members: to date, 23 of the 28 member states recognize the authority of Pristina.13Spain, Slovakia, Cyprus, Romania, and Greece do not recognize Kosovo's independence, and, as a result, the EU itself refers only to ‘Kosovo’. In 1992 The OSCE established the Minsk Group to settle the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Since 2014, the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine (Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and the OSCE) is seeking he peaceful settlement of the situation in eastern Ukraine (i.e.,the  Donbass). Conclusions Since it was created by the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, the EU is facing difficulties in addressing and settle crisis. So far, the EU proved unable to solve alone the conflicts that have arisen at its doors, with the long time running Israeli–Palestinian and Cyprus issue still unfixed. Other international organizations –i.e., NATO and OSCE–intervened to resolve some of these conflicts. Despite the overlap of some of these organizations, that share theirs members with the EU, the Union is not able to achieve an ownership in the field of peace, stability and security at its borders, and and his claim to be a global actor proves weak-willed. It would be useful to investigate the reasons for this incapacity: lack of a real and exclusive autonomy in matters of foreign policy; lack of a European army; subjection to US-led NATO; national interest of EU member states.},

	abstract = {Congressional scholars, like members of the House and Senate, have paid far more attention to domestic affairs than to foreign and defense policy. For much of the era after the Second World War, the president dominated the international arena buoyed by the vast national security bureaucracy and the deference of lawmakers fearful of nuclear war. Scholars saw little knowledge to be gained, apparently, in examining legislative activity during the Cold War consensus that stretched from 1947 to 1968. In hindsight, less consensus and less deference prevailed during that period than many observers assumed. With the legitimacy of the presidency in tatters after Vietnam and Watergate, however, Congress entered a period of resurgence. Lawmakers attempted greater control over military action through the War Powers Resolution and the creation of new committees to monitor the intelligence community, and they dramatically increased the frequency of oversight hearings. The activism lasted into the 1990s and continued until members of Congress lapsed into quiescence after 9/11. The renewed activity on the Hill following Watergate stimulated scholarly interest in the activities of lawmakers with respect to foreign affairs. The questions were similar to those of previous decades, despite variation in congressional influence and scholarly efforts to explain it. The debate about the constitutional prerogatives of the executive and legislative branches, for example, remained a lively one, with the preponderance of scholarly opinion assigning greater weight to Congress than presidents have been willing to concede. In addition, evidence regarding the extent of legislative influence over foreign policy decisions remained contestable, as scholars grappled with inadequate data, “hidden hand” maneuvers of actors in both branches, and tendencies among lawmakers to assess defense programs with an eye to local economic benefits. Despite the numerous analyses of events in which Congress engaged the president, the triggers for legislative interventions and their impact on policy decisions have remained unclear. Increasingly, researchers have identified lawmakers’ primary power as the ability to organize public discourse about foreign affairs and cue citizens to potential problems with the president’s actions. This is a formidable weapon if members choose to use it—or if presidents fear they might. Nevertheless, the president retained a decided advantage in the “struggle” with Congress, even to the extent of gaining additional leverage in domestic matters. Whatever the level of legislative activity and influence, members of Congress appear to pay for presidents’ unpopular wars at election time. Unable to escape the consequences of executive discretion, lawmakers may yet revive their capacity for participation in the realm of foreign affairs and stimulate a new round of research. Several more recent essays, however, suggest that lawmakers have proved unable or unwilling to challenge President Obama effectively or assert themselves in dealing with President Trump.},

	abstract = {Background: This systematic review analyzes the factors that influence home advantage in basketball across various competitions in the United States and Europe. Methods: Through an investigation of English- and Spanish-language articles published in EBSCO, Scopus, Consensus, and Web of Science between 2010 and 2024 related to home advantage in basketball, 1682 articles were initially identified. After applying specific filters to ensure that only articles concerning National Basketball Association (NBA), Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA), Euroleague, Spanish basketball, and European basketball were considered, 39 articles met the final requirements for in-depth analysis. Results: The studies analyzed in this review suggested that player performance, player position, and sleep influenced home advantage in competitions in Europe and the United States. Fan behavior had a bigger impact in European competitions, where teams from capital cities have a lower home advantage. In the United States, where teams must travel long distances to play, several studies indicated that teams traveling eastwards tend to perform more strongly than teams traveling westwards. Also of note is that, in many cases, COVID-19 pandemic restrictions reduced home advantage. Conclusions: This review identifies factors contributing to home advantage in basketball, compares competitions in different regions, and proposes ideas for future research such as a greater focus on women’s competitions, the impact of television, and the introduction of new performance indicators.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Τhe possible audience effect on basketball game-related statistics in a natural setting has not been itself investigated. The EuroLeague Basketball, began the 2020-21 season with restrictions on audience attendance at the games, depending on national and/or local health guidelines, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Αs a consequence, these extreme conditions provided the rare opportunity to explore the possible effect of homeaudience advantage (HAA) on the most important basketball game-related statistical indexes of team technical performance (Team Performance Indicators – [TPIs]) during the last two regular seasons (2019-21) with an audience and with no audience in a natural setting. Material and Methods: The TPIs (e.g., Points, Rebounds, Fouls) derived from the same 17 teams and 112 games that took place in each season based on predefined inclusion-exclusion criteria and provided by EuroLeague’s official site. Home advantage (HA) of the included teams was calculated as the number of home wins expressed in a percentage (\%) of the total number of games included for analysis in each season (i.e., N=112). It was assumed that, except of the possible audience effect, the interaction of various factors which could impair HA would be equal in both seasons and all teams; thus, HAA per se would be reflected in the difference of home advantage between the two seasons. Results: The home teams won significantly more games with an audience (69) in comparison to away teams (43), whereas with no audience they did not. In the season 2019-20 the HA was 61.60\%, 4.46\% of which corresponds to HAA. Most TPIs were not affected by the presence or absence of an audience and were not different between home and away teams. However, home teams with an audience committed significantly (p{\textless}0.05) fewer Turnovers (11.92±1.95) in comparison to home teams without an audience (13.33±1.26). Discussion: Our findings confirmed, not only the existence of the HAA, but also the significant interaction of HAA on HA phenomenon and revealed that audience support was a necessary precondition for the HA when the away team was not equally familiar with the stadium as the home team in EuroLeague’s regular season. This knowledge of the teams’ performance may help teams’ personnel, psychologists, and coaches to develop proper game strategies, training and mental practices which may further improve the teams’ technical performance. Conclusions: Findings supported the notion that HAA has a strong effect on winning frequency and on reducing Turnovers of home teams.},

We gathered data for game locations and results from open online sources for all games in the First Division (ACB), Second Division (LEB Gold), and Third Division (LEB Silver) Spanish male basketball leagues between 2010–2023. The dataset included 12 seasons, 635 teams (215 First Division, 203, Second Division, and 217 Third Division), and 19,539 games (7075 First Division, 6344 Second Division, and 5520 Third Division). We calculated HA [(total home wins/total wins) * 100] and HW [(total home wins/total home games) * 100] for each team across each season. We performed Kruskal Wallis tests, calculated partial eta squared (ηp2), and performed Mann-Whitney U tests with rank biserial correlation (rb) effect sizes and Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner pairwise comparisons to compare HA and HW between leagues and between team abilities (low, medium, and/or high) within each league. There was a significant effect for HA between leagues (p = .01) with post hoc comparisons revealing a higher HA for the First Division than for the Third Division (p = .01), but HW was not significantly different between leagues. In turn, variations in HA and HW between team abilities were consistent across playing levels, with HW significantly increasing in a progressive manner with higher team abilities (p {\textless} .001) and with HA significantly lower among high-level teams compared to lower-ability team clusters (p {\textless} .01). These findings emphasize the importance of considering playing level and team ability and interpreting HA and HW together to contextualize an apparent home advantage in Spanish basketball.},

	abstract = {The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the major professional basketball league in the United States. Home-court advantage (HA) and home win percentage (HW) have been identified as decisive factors in determining the final outcome of a game. This study analyzes a total of 24 regular seasons, with two main objectives: (i) comparing HA and HW within the two conferences and (ii) examining the influence of team ability on HA and HW. HA (\%) was calculated as (total home wins/total wins) × 100, and HW (\%) as (total home wins/total home games) × 100. Teams were categorized into four different groups based on their season win percentage using cluster analyses. Regarding the first aim, we used an Independent Samples T-test and Mann–Whitney to assess differences between conferences. Subsequently, we evaluated the second objective using one-way ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis. The results indicated no significant differences in HA within conferences. However, Western teams tended to have a higher HW than Eastern teams. The analyses revealed significantly higher HA in contender teams compared to the rest of the team abilities (p {\textless} 0.001). High–medium-ability teams also showed a significantly higher HA (p {\textless} 0.001) compared to low-ability teams. However, non-significant differences were found between the remaining groups for HA. Regarding HW, we observed significantly higher values in the contender teams compared to the teams with other ability levels (p {\textless} 0.001). Additionally, the high–medium-ability teams also exhibited significantly higher HW values (p {\textless} 0.001) when compared to the medium–low- and low-ability teams. Furthermore, the medium–low-ability teams showed significantly higher HW values (p {\textless} 0.001) when compared to the low-ability teams. Those findings suggest that team ability influences HA and HW in the NBA, where contender teams have significantly higher HW and HA values compared to the teams with other team ability levels. Understanding these dynamics provides valuable insights for team strategies, particularly during playoff stages where home-court advantage can be critical for success.},

После глобальной пандемии Covid‑2019, в течение которой имел место уникальный в истории баскетбола “естественный эксперимент” по проведению матчей без зрителей и с ограниченным числом зрителей для соблюдения социальной дистанции, появилась возможность более детально изучить вклад социально-психологических и поведенческих факторов в домашнее преимущество. В статье представлен сравнительный анализ статистических данных матчей Национальной баскетбольной Ассоциации и ведущих европейских лиг в пандемию и допандемийные сезоны. Показано, что социально-психологические (влияние болельщиков на игроков и судей) и поведенческие факторы (усталость от длительных переездов и нарушение циркадных ритмов у игроков гостевой команды) определяют уровень преимущества домашней площадки в европейских лигах и НБА. В пандемию в матчах без зрителей преимущество домашней площадки отсутствовало или снижалось, по сравнению с допандемийным уровнем. Сила воздействия отдельного социально-психологического или поведенческого фактора на домашнее преимущество варьирует в зависимости от географических размеров страны и мастерства команд.

Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests were employed to analyse variables with normal and non-normal distributions, respectively. The analysis indicated significant differences (p{\textless}0.05) between local and foreign players across several key variables, including Minutes, Points, Average Points, Usage Percentage, Individual Offensive Rating, Individual Defensive Rating, and True Shooting Percentage. These findings suggest pronounced distinctions between foreign players and national players concerning game volume indicators and game performance efficiency. Foreign players exhibited dominance in critical areas, such as playing time, total points scored, and average points per game, underscoring their substantial contributions to their respective teams. Consequently, these results offer practical implications for players, coaches, and fitness trainers, allowing for the design of more tailored training programs that account for distinct offensive and defensive needs, as well as the heightened physical demands experienced throughout the season.},

We used Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney U tests to identify HA through differences in home win percentages (HW\%) between pre-pandemic and pandemic games. Additionally, we ran the Kruskal–Wallis test to identify HA and HW\% differences between different team ability levels (high to low). Teams had higher HA and HW\% pre-pandemic than during the pandemic. In turn, low level teams presented a higher HA compared to teams at other team ability levels. Thus, low level teams benefited more from playing at their home-court.

Additionally, the chapter focuses on several external factors, difficult to control, but susceptible to affect players and teams’ performance.},

In this article, it is shown how questions about the size of the home-court advantage and about team-to-team differences in the home-court advantage can be addressed by fitting three different linear models to the outcomes of college basketball games. This approach was applied to data from the 1991–1992 college basketball season. The advantage of playing at home (in relation to playing on a neutral court) was estimated to be 4.68 ± 0.28 points. The effect of team-to-team differences in the home-court advantage was found to be relatively small.},

The purpose of the present paper is to provide a conceptual framework to organize a comprehensive review of previous game location research and provide direction for future research. The review of literature indicated that the descriptive phase of inquiry has been completed, and it is time to address the underlying mechanisms responsible for the manifestation of the home advantage.

	abstract = {Philosophical research tends to be done separately from empirical research, but this makes it difficult to tackle questions which require both. To make it easier to address these hybrid research questions, I argue that we should sometimes combine philosophical and empirical investigations. I start by describing a continuum of research methods from data collecting and analysing to philosophical arguing and conceptualising. Then, I outline one possible middle-ground position where research is equally philosophical and empirical: the Community of Inquiry reconceived as a research method. In this method, a group of participants (the community) engage in philosophical discussion and dialogue to answer the research question (the inquiry). I argue that this collaborative philosophical inquiry, moderated by a philosopher, provides a new method for collecting and testing data. The results are philosophical positions and arguments blended with empirical findings. Next, I illustrate how I used this philosophical–empirical method in a recent study to evaluate the strength of educational metaphors. I conclude that the Community of Inquiry is a viable means of combining philosophical and empirical research, and a new and worthwhile method for research in education.},

	abstract = {What would it mean to cultivate a culture of thriving people on a thriving planet? Research has shown that intrinsic values are a significant predictor of both environmentally responsible behaviour and mental wellbeing. However, in modern Western culture, extrinsic, self-promotional values continue to grow in prominence. In order to examine how a specific social context may be exacerbating extrinsic values, counter to mental and ecological wellbeing, this study looks at the social media platform Instagram. Through in-depth interviews of young adults in Aotearoa New Zealand, this study examines their experiences of Instagram in order to ascertain if and how it may promote extrinsic values. Results were analysed through Self Determination Theory, which states that environments which thwart basic human needs of relatedness, competence and autonomy will incentivise extrinsic values. While in some cases, Instagram increased access to relatedness, participants also experienced thwarted relatedness when interactions became motivated predominantly by posting them, and thus self-promoting, on the platform. Participants also consistently reported feeling incompetent when comparing themselves to others' images, which, particularly when adjacent to advertising, as in the case of Instagram, is likely to lead to materialistic tendencies. Participants were also aware of, and in some cases responded to, Instagram signals as to what type of content would gain more 'likes,' adjusting their behaviour in order to succeed in a 'marketplace' infrastructure, thereby limiting autonomy. In doing so, intrinsically motivated experiences were overtaken by an extrinsic desire to portray them to others. These examples indicate Instagram’s infrastructural incentives toward extrinsic values, which counter societal goals of mental and ecological wellbeing. Pervasive messaging within social contexts such as Instagram needs to shift away from promoting extrinsic values in order to respond adequately to the current ecological challenges and create conditions conducive to mental wellbeing.},

While scholarly responses to social media continue to bechallenged by the rapidly evolving nature of these technologies, theurgent need for attention to the social networking phenomenon isunderscored by the fact that it has profoundly reshaped how many humanbeings initiate and/or maintain virtually every type of ethicallysignificant social bond or role: friend-to-friend, parent-to-child,co-worker-to co-worker, employer-to-employee, teacher-to-student,neighbor-to-neighbor, seller-to-buyer, doctor-to-patient, andvoter-to-voter, to offer just a partial list. Nor are the ethicalimplications of these technologies strictly interpersonal, as it hasbecome evident that social networking services (hereafter referred toas SNS) and other new digital media have profound implications fordemocracy, public institutions and the rule of law. The complex web ofinteractions between SNS developers and users, and their online andoffline communities, corporations and governments—along with thediverse and sometimes conflicting motives and interests of thesevarious stakeholders—will continue to require rigorous ethicalanalysis for decades to come.},

A secondary objective was to analyze how team ability interacted with HA by comparing HA affects pre-pandemic and during the pandemic in the context of differing team ability levels. We used Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney U tests to identify HA through differences in home win percentages (HW\%) between pre-pandemic and pandemic games. Additionally, we ran the Kruskal–Wallis test to identify HA and HW\% differences between different team ability levels (high to low). Teams had higher HA and HW\% pre-pandemic than during the pandemic. In turn, low level teams presented a higher HA compared to teams at other team ability levels. Thus, low level teams benefited more from playing at their home-court. However, low level teams showed lower HW\% than medium and high team ability levels, showing that team ability is more important than HA in determining game outcomes.},

From the accumulated evidence, rule factors were found to play only a minor role (in a limited number of sports) in contributing to home advantage. Studies investigating the effect of learning factors found that little benefit was to be gained from being familiar with the local conditions when playing at home. There was evidence to suggest that travel factors were responsible for part of the home advantage, provided the journey involved crossing a number of time zones. However, since high levels of home advantage are observed within countries where travel distances are not great, travel factors were not thought to be a major cause of home advantage. The evidence from studies investigating crowd factors appeared to provide the most dominant causes of home advantage.},

	abstract = {Though the home court advantage in college basketball is universally recognized, it is not completely understood. Researchers have put forth many theories to explain the higher probability of victory for the home team, which fit into four basic categories: scheduling consideration, court familiarity, travel time, and crowd contribution. Statistical Methods were employed to test the validity of these theories and the following variables were analyzed: probability of victory during preconference and conference play; margin of victory for the home team for short, medium, and long road trips for visitors; shooting percentage of the home team and shooting percentage of the visiting team; and the difference between fouls, blocks, steals, etc. for the home team and the visiting team. These findings seem to indicate that easy preconference scheduling is inflating perception of the home court advantage. Also, travel considerations no longer adversely affect the visiting team. Furthermore, the home team doesn’t shoot significantly better long distance shots at their home court. Finally, the crowd does have a measurable effect on the performance of the home team, perhaps by spurring players to be more aggressive defenders or by influencing the referees.},

	abstract = {Studies have consistently shown that crowds contribute to home advantage in the National Basketball Association (NBA) by inspiring home team effort, distracting opponents, and influencing referees. Quantifying the effect of crowds is challenging, however, due to potential co-occurring drivers of home advantage (e.g., travel, location familiarity). The present research aims to isolate the crowd effect by utilizing a ‘natural experiment’ created by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which eliminated crowds in 577 of 1080 (53.4\%) 2020/2021 NBA regular season games. Multi-level mixed models (fixed effect: crowds; random effects: team, opponent) were used to analyze the effect of crowds on performance metrics while controlling for team and opponent strength. We show, in games with crowds, home teams won 58.65\% of games and outrebounded (average rebound differential = 2.28 rebounds) and outscored (average points differential = 2.18 points) their opponents. This was a significant improvement compared to games without crowds, of which home teams won 50.60\% of games (p {\textless} .001) and failed to outrebound (average rebound differential = -0.41 rebounds, p {\textless} .001) or outscore (average points differential = -0.13 points, p {\textless} .05) their opponents. Further, the crowd-related increase in average rebound differential fully mediated the relationship between crowds and average points differential. Finally, among games with crowds, crowd size and density were not related to performance. Taken together, these results suggest that home advantage in the 2020/2021 NBA season was predominately driven by the mere presence of home crowds and their influence on the effort exerted to rebound the basketball. These findings are of considerable significance to a league where marginal gains can have immense competitive, financial, and historic consequences.},

We develop an economic model of digital addiction and estimate it using a randomized experiment. Temporary incentives to reduce social media use have persistent effects, suggesting social media are habit forming. Allowing people to set limits on their future screen time substantially reduces use, suggesting self-control problems. Additional evidence suggests people are inattentive to habit formation and partially unaware of self-control problems. Looking at these facts through the lens of our model suggests that self-control problems cause 31 percent of social media use.},

	abstract = {Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call “moral contagion.” Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20\% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.},

This article explores conscious, instrumental interactions with algorithms, as a window into the complexities and extent of algorithmic power. Through a thematic analysis of online discussions among Instagram influencers, I observed that influencers’ pursuit of influence resembles a game constructed around “rules” encoded in algorithms. Within the “visibility game,” influencers’ interpretations of Instagram’s algorithmic architecture—and the “game” more broadly—act as a lens through which to view and mechanize the rules of the game. Illustrating this point, this article describes two prominent interpretations, which combine information influencers glean about Instagram’s algorithms with preexisting discourses within influencer communities on authenticity and entrepreneurship. This article shows how directing inquiries toward the visibility game makes present the interdependency between users, algorithms, and platform owners and demonstrates how algorithms structure, but do not unilaterally determine user behavior.},

College basketball games were attended by investigators who used a behavior observation technique to isolate blocks of game time immediately following instances of sustained spectator protest. For both home and visiting teams four measures of performance occurring during these "postbooing" periods were compared with performance during normal crowd conditions. Analyses of variance on scoring, turnover, foul, and composite performance rates revealed that episodes of spectator protest were related to an increase in the performance advantages enjoyed by home teams. Subsequent to crowd protest there were slight improvements in the performance indicators of home teams, paralleled by more significant declines for visiting teams. These declines were statiscally significant for two of the four dependent variables-fouls committed, and composite performance. Two competing interpretations of these results were considered at length, and the conclusion that crowd noise had inhibited the performance quality of visiting teams was favored over the alternative interpretation that the judgment of game referees had been influenced. In either case, the data, appeared to be consistent with the belief that collective protest by sports crowds is an effective type of social support which can contribute significantly to the HA.},

The degree of home advantage was found to vary significantly across the divisions. Furthermore, these divisional differences in home advantage were found to be significantly associated with the mean attendance of each division. In an attempt to understand these findings, every occurrence of two influential events (either a sending‐off or penalty scored) reported in a national Sunday newspaper was recorded. The overall frequency of both sendings‐off and penalties scored favoured the home side, but again this was not constant across the divisions. In divisions with large crowds, the percentage of home sendings‐off was relatively small (30\%), compared with no difference (50\%) in divisions with smaller crowds. Similarly, the percentage of penalties scored by home sides in divisions with the largest crowds was large ({\textgreater} 70\%), in contrast to little or no advantage in divisions with smaller crowds. Two possible explanations for these findings were proposed. Either larger crowds were able to provoke the away player into more reckless behaviour (real fouls), or influence the referee into believing that the away player had committed more fouls (perceived fouls).},

	abstract = {Several recent studies suggest that the home advantage, that is, the benefit competitors accrue from performing in familiar surroundings, was—at least temporarily—reduced in games played without spectators due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. These games played without fans during the Pandemic have been dubbed ‘ghost games’. However, the majority of the research to date focus on soccer and no contributions have been provided for indoor sports, where the effect of the support of the fans might have a stronger impact than in outdoor arenas. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by investigating the effect of ghost games in basketball with a special focus on the possible reduction of the home advantage due to the absence of spectators inside the arena. In particular, we test (i) for the reduction of the home advantage in basketball, (ii) whether such reduction tends to disappear over time, (iii) if the bookmakers promptly adapt to such structural change or whether mispricing was created on the betting market. The results from a large data set covering all seasons since 2004 for the ten most popular and followed basketball leagues in Europe show, on the one hand, an overall significant reduction of the home advantage of around 5\% and no evidence that suggests that this effect has been reduced at as teams became more accustomed to playing without fans; on the other hand, bookmakers appear to have anticipated such effect and priced home win in basketball matches accordingly, thus avoiding creating mispricing on betting markets.},

We use attendance restrictions in place during the 2020?2021 National Basketball Association regular season as an instrument in order to identify the effect of fans and crowd size on home-court advantage. We show that home teams win by 2.13 points, on average, when fans are present at games compared with 0.44 points when no fans are present. This equates to winning approximately 2.2 additional home games over the course of a regular season. In fixed effects instrumental variables regression models, we estimate that the marginal effect of an additional one thousand fans on home-court advantage is 1.7 points. We conclude that the mere presence of home fans, on its own, explains a larger share of home-court advantage than previously thought.},

The advantage was found to be greatest in soccer, with the home team currently obtaining about 64\% of all points gained in the English Football League. Home advantage has changed very little since the formation of the League in 1888 and there are only small variations between the four Divisions of the League. The advantage is less marked in local derbies, in the FA Cup and in non‐professional competitions. It is greater in the European Cup and increases as the stages of the competition progress. The allocation of three points, instead of two, for a win in the Football League has not changed home advantage, but its effect has been greatly reduced in the GM Vauxhall Conference where an away win gains more points than a home win. The statistical evidence suggests that crowd support and travel fatigue contribute less to home advantage in soccer than do the less easily quantifiable benefits of familiarity with conditions when playing at home. Further possible explanations for the advantage are discussed in the light of findings in other sports.},

	abstract = {Four teams in the four divisions of the English Football League have been playing their home matches on artificial pitch surfaces at certain times over the last 10 years or so. A Commission of Enquiry (Football League, 1989) recently recommended that the introduction of further artificial pitches be restricted. One of the factors leading to this recommendation was the possible advantage gained by the home team on such pitches. A statistical analysis of the end-of-season results for the four divisions over the last 10 years (carried out for the Football League) showed that there is indeed such an advantage and that it is of a sufficient scale to be a cause for concern.},
